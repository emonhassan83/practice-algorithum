This repository contains solutions to various algorithmic problems covered in an algorithm course. The solutions include implementations of fundamental and advanced algorithms, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms, along with problem-solving techniques. Each module focuses on building a deep understanding of algorithmic principles and applying them to complex problems.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

The repository is organized by topics, with each folder representing a specific data structure or algorithm. Inside each folder, you will find:

- **Implementation Files**: Code files that include the basic implementation of the data structure or algorithm.
- **Problem-Solving Files**: Code files that contain problem-solving examples and use cases.
- **README.md** (inside each folder): A brief explanation of the topic and how the solutions are structured.

Each folder is organized with subfolders for individual algorithms and problem-solving exercises, including code files and brief documentation.
